    "### Using Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "You are now officially using a Jupyter notebook! If this is your first time using a Jupyter notebook you might want to go through the Db2 Data Management Console Hands on Lab at www.ibm.biz/DMCDemosPOT. It includes an introduction to using Jupyter notebooks with the Db2 family. The introduction shows you some of the basics of using a notebook, including how to create the cells, run code, and save files for future use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are based on IPython which started in development in the 2006/7 timeframe. The existing Python interpreter was limited in functionality and work was started to create a richer development environment. By 2011 the development efforts resulted in IPython being released (http://blog.fperez.org/2012/01/ipython-notebook-historical.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks were a spinoff (2014) from the original IPython project. IPython continues to be the kernel that Jupyter runs on, but the notebooks are now a project on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks run in a browser and communicate to the backend IPython server which renders this content. These notebooks are used extensively by data scientists and anyone wanting to document, plot, and execute their code in an interactive environment. The beauty of Jupyter notebooks is that you document what you do as you go along."

    "To access the service you need to first authenticate with the service and create a reusable token that we can use for each call to the service. This ensures that we don't have to provide a userID and password each time we run a command. The token makes sure this is secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each request is constructed of several parts. First, the URL and the API identify how to connect to the service. Second the REST service request that identifies the request and the options. For example '/metrics/applications/connections/current/list'. And finally some complex requests also include a JSON payload. For example running SQL includes a JSON object that identifies the script, statement delimiters, the maximum number of rows in the results set as well as what do if a statement fails."
